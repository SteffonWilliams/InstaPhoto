# InstaPhoto
Due to my love of coding and photography I will be building an Instagram clone. I am using Spring Boot for the backend,
Angular for the frontend and Instagram's API. My goals are to reafirm what I already know about Spring Boot, build a RestFul
application and immerse myself in frontend development using Angular. 

*Currently developing the backend.
